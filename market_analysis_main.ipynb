    "## Little Story\n",
    "I recently started on Upwork and invested over $200 in connects, but I wasn't seeing any success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determined to figure out why, I realized that being new to the platform and lacking badges was a factor, but there wasn't much I could do about that, since I'm just stating. I then thought my proposals might be the issue and tried to improve them, but still had no luck.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s when I decided to create a client account to get an insider’s perspective. By posting a job, I noticed something crucial: the **first two lines of a proposal are vital**. Clients see a list of proposals with only the first two lines visible, so **these lines need to be a compelling hook**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this insight, I wondered if perhaps my profile wasn’t aligned with current market demands. This led me to undertake a market data analysis on Upwork. I began by gathering months' worth of RSS feeds containing job listings to understand better what clients are looking for today."

Ideally you would have done this before with a similar business.What I have in mind is a combination of charts and pivot table to give a quick overview of how the business is tracking in terms of sales revenue. Understand what is currently in demand and identify top sellers as well as keeping track of COGS, Source of business, Gross Profit, marketing channels, Average Transaction Value (ATV) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).We receive an email with a CSV file from our CRM and the end of each business day, which has all the details of the transactions for that business day. The CSV files are then transferred and stored in a Dropbox folder rather than using Googles platform.Wondering if all this can be done just using Excel or it is better to use Power BI for a more user-friendly experience for my client.Also wondering if it can collect phone tracking CSVs from our Google Ads account and correlate phone numbers from Google Ads tracking with phone numbers from our CRM so we can see which customers actually ended up buying and how much they spent. Point of sale is via phone calls and Google Phone tracking CSVs from each campaign are also downloaded to a Dropbox FolderFetching data from Dropbox data sources containing CSV files . Can Excel or Power BI be setup to automatically fetch data on a daily basis whenever a new CSV file enters the folder?

The CSV files are then transferred and stored in a Dropbox folder rather than using Googles platform.Wondering if all this can be done just using Excel or it is better to use Power BI for a more user-friendly experience for my client.Also wondering if it can collect phone tracking CSVs from our Google Ads account and correlate phone numbers from Google Ads tracking with phone numbers from our CRM so we can see which customers actually ended up buying and how much they spent. Point of sale is via phone calls and Google Phone tracking CSVs from each campaign are also downloaded to a Dropbox FolderFetching data from Dropbox data sources containing CSV files .

Ideally you would have done this before with a similar business.What I have in mind is a combination of charts and pivot table to give a quick overview of how the business is tracking in terms of sales revenue. Understand what is currently in demand and identify top sellers as well as keeping track of COGS, Source of business, Gross Profit, marketing channels, Average Transaction Value (ATV) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).We receive an email with a CSV file from our CRM and the end of each business day, which has all the details of the transactions for that business day. The CSV files are then transferred and stored in a Dropbox folder rather than using Googles platform.Wondering if all this can be done just using Excel or it is better to use Power BI for a more user-friendly experience for my client.Also wondering if it can collect phone tracking CSVs from our Google Ads account and correlate phone numbers from Google Ads tracking with phone numbers from our CRM so we can see which customers actually ended up buying and how much they spent. Point of sale is via phone calls and Google Phone tracking CSVs from each campaign are also downloaded to a Dropbox FolderFetching data from Dropbox data sources containing CSV files . Can Excel or Power BI be setup to automatically fetch data on a daily basis whenever a new CSV file enters the folder?
