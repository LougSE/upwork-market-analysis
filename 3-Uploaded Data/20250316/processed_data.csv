We have a function stored on our Azure platform that is connected to a SQL Server table that holds a unique url that when entered into a browser changes another value on the same table to show that record has been seen and actioned by the user.<br /><br />
We need to be able to trigger this url in a PowerBi table so we can update the tracking value in our table.&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue is that by default PowerBi opens a browser window.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />
We need someone to help us overcome this so when the your is selected the value changes without opening a browser. We are happy to use Power Automate to achieve this, but need a detailed answer on what it requires us to do.<br /><br />

for Tyre Retailer and Mechanical Service business.<br /><br />
Looking to create a data visualization dashboard to easily glean a quick overview of important business KPIs using charts and pivot tables.<br />
Looking for a Data Analysist who can help transform lots of data points into useful data visualization and so my client can quickly understand&nbsp;&nbsp;and interpret important business KPIs. Ideally you would have done this before with a similar business.<br />
What I have in mind is a combination of charts and pivot table to give a quick overview of how the business is tracking in terms of sales revenue. Understand what is currently in demand and identify top sellers as well as keeping track of COGS, Source of business, Gross Profit, marketing channels, Average Transaction Value (ATV) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).<br />
We receive an email with a CSV file from our CRM and the end of each business day, which has all the details of the transactions for that business day. <br />
The CSV files are then transferred and stored in a Dropbox folder rather than using Google&rsquo;s platform.<br /><br />
Wondering if all this can be done just using Excel or it is better to use Power BI for a more user-friendly experience for my client.<br />
Also wondering if it can collect phone tracking CSVs from our Google Ads account and correlate phone numbers from Google Ads tracking with phone numbers from our CRM so we can see which customers actually ended up buying and how much they spent. Point of sale is via phone calls and Google Phone tracking CSVs from each campaign are also downloaded to a Dropbox Folder<br /><br />
Fetching data from Dropbox data sources containing CSV files .<br />
&bull;	Can Excel or Power BI be setup to automatically fetch data on a daily basis whenever a new CSV file enters the folder?<br />
&bull;	Wondering if all this can be done just using Excel or it is better to use Power BI for a more user friendly experience.<br /><br />

This opportunity requires Philosophical Creativity in combination with a desire to dive deep into the theory behind our vision, to help us to reason through and design complex formulas.<br />
The ideal candidate will become a long- term consultant, helping us define and build the reports necessary to provide transparency on the health of the progression of each of our projects, as well as the individual (and collective) contribution performance of the staff, including technicians and administrative team members, to ultimately visualize these and other organizational KPI&#039;s.<br />
We have been developing on the Microsoft Power Platform for several years. Consequently, we have created many fields/ columns of custom data that we need to turn into performance visualizations. This will require initially gaining an understanding of what we currently have, and what the intention is/was behind each customization. We will then work together on defining, articulating and refining our theory, formulas and business processes. Ww have already developed both SSRS reports and Power BI reports, but still need to dive much deeper into the weeds to achieve our vision. <br />

About You<br />
â— You are a hands-on expert in system integration, data warehousing (or at least ETL specification and development), and reporting.<br />
â— You are experienced at team leadership: assigning work, managing delivery, and addressing risks and issues. Initially, you will have only two people to share tasks with. But, the team will grow as our customer<br /><br />
Responsibilities<br />
Customer Onboarding<br />
â— You will work alongside and in lock step with Sales, Product and Customer Success directly with customers during the onboarding of new customers on the company SaaS platform.<br />
â— You will define and implement processes that enable you to collect customer-specific implementation requirements and configurations and oversee smooth implementation for each customer.<br />
â— Working with the Customer Success Team, you will determine how the customer plans to use the company&rsquo;s system and the data that the customer will supply. You will rely on your strong communication and interpersonal skills to build relationships and ensure everyone is aligned.<br />
â— Reporting<br />
â—‹ You will work with customers to understand reporting requirements and recommend visualizations.<br />
â— Customer Data Integration<br />
â—‹ You will work with the customer to specify and implement client data integrations through third party APIs or flat file feeds.<br />
â—‹ You will define and oversee the specification and development of ETL required to populate our application for each customer.<br />
â—‹ You will specify customer-specific data model changes required to support reporting requirements and oversee the implementation of these changes.<br />
â—‹ You will specify and oversee the implementation of any customizations to our platform required to allow us to comply with our customers&rsquo; information security and compliance requirements.<br />
â—‹ You will oversee implementation of SSO connectivity between the company and customer systems<br />
Human Resource Capacity Planning<br />
â— You will develop and manage a capacity plan for your support team and formulate a staff management plan to support projected customer launches. (The data for this planning can come from our issue tracking system where we track time and from the insights you gain from managing customer implementations. Ideally, we can largely automate this capacity planning process.)<br />
Customer Technical Support<br />
â— You and your team will provide the customer ongoing support, troubleshooting issues, and ensuring optimal platform functioning and performance.<br />

Expert Power Bi Developer for Dashboard (3 pages and single Excel data source) - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Expert-Power-Developer-for-Dashboard-pages-and-single-Excel-data-source_%7E01736256a99c2a4ee1?source=rss,Spain,Data Visualization,"['Dashboard', 'Microsoft Power BI', 'Data Visualization', 'Business Intelligence', 'Data Modeling']",2024-05-15T16:38:00,False,,,2.0,"I am looking for a seasoned expert in PowerBi in order to implement a dashboard and your profile looks very interesting to me. I provide you below with a broad generic description of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;If interested,&nbsp;&nbsp;please feel free to reach me for more detailed questions.<br /><br />
Project Overview:<br />
Develop a dashboard for an internal tool within a diverse organizational context. The dashboard will display monthly performance across several distinct organizational areas. It will provide aggregated visualizations to track performance against fixed set targets using various charts (barplot, donut, timeline), summary tables, maps, and interactive elements such data drills and slicers. The primary audience will be project managers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Visualizations might include aggregated numerical tables, some maps and other easy to interpret visualizations (timelines, barplots and donut charts) with drill menus and a timeline slicer by months (with cumulative figures functionality). The audience is mostly project managers so no need for very complicated visuals. The dashboard will very likely include 3 separate sheets<br /><br />
Technical Requirements:<br /><br />
- The data source will be a unique Excel workbook with several sheets for each organizational unit<br />
- You will not need to deal with the Excel itself, as it is already prepared to collect the data in a clean way using many internal validations and dropdowns to ensure that the data feeded to PowerBi is as clean as possible<br />
- Initial query connections and data wrangling will be done to provide a combined dataset for easy filtering, as a starting point.<br />
- The PowerBi .pbix and Excel data source file will be hosted on the same SharePoint folder for seamless connection<br />
- Each of the organizational units excel sheets have identical column names across areas, with variations in some specific indicator categories depending on the organizational unit.<br />
- Data will usually be aggregated at subnational level1 and second subnational level2. Entities have standardized names to facilitate PowerBI mapping capabilities. Map visualizations will be either bubble maps or choropleth.<br />
- Draft wireframes with suggested visuals and tables will be provided to guide the development process<br />
- Guidance and feedback will be provided through the phases to facilitate the specialist work.<br />
- More details on the project will be provided to preselected candidates in order to better frame the scope<br /><br />
I look forward to collaborating with a skilled specialist to create the basis for an effective and user-friendly dashboard within the suggested timeframe and budget.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $2,000

We are seeking an experienced SQL and ETL specialist to assist us in automating the data extraction and transformation process for Power BI reporting. We have software where users can create their own forms. The data from these forms is stored in various tables within a SQL database.<br /><br />
Currently, manually crafting queries and merging these tables to generate usable reports in Power BI is a complex process. We aim to automate and simplify this process so that dynamic forms can be easily and directly converted into a usable format for Power BI.<br /><br />
Project Requirements:<br /><br />
1. Analysis of Current Data Structure:<br />
Understand and document the current database structure and data relationships.<br /><br />
2. Dynamic SQL View Creation:<br />
Develop a stored procedure that creates dynamic views based on available forms and fields.<br />
These views should automatically select and present the correct columns in a flat format suitable for Power BI.<br /><br />
3. ETL Pipeline Development:<br />
Develop an ETL pipeline (preferably in Python) that periodically extracts, transforms, and loads the data into a reporting table in the database.<br />
This pipeline must be flexible enough to automatically detect and process new forms and fields.<br /><br />
4. Documentation and Handover:<br />
Provide comprehensive documentation of the developed system, including instructions for adding new forms and maintaining the system.<br />
Transfer knowledge and code to our internal team to enable them to perform maintenance and make any necessary adjustments.<br /><br />
Required Skills:<br />
- Extensive experience with SQL and relational databases.<br />
- Experience developing dynamic SQL queries and views.<br />
- Knowledge of ETL processes and tools.<br />
- Experience in data modeling and transformation for reporting purposes, especially for Power BI.<br />

I hope this message finds you well. I have an important task that requires your expertise, and I would greatly appreciate your guidance on completing it.<br /><br />
Available Tools and Software: <br />
To help you provide the best possible solution, here are the tools and software we have on our PCs for this task:<br />
&bull;	Word/ Excel / Power BI / Power Automate / Power Query / Microsoft Lists / Outlook / SharePoint / OneDrive<br /><br />
Background: <br />
Within our company, there are 10 departments. Each department produces daily reports with a significant amount of data. These reports are sent daily via Outlook to Department A, which is responsible for collecting and storing them in PC memory, OneDrive, and SharePoint. Each department has its own folder, named by the department&rsquo;s name, where their daily reports are saved.<br /><br />
Your Task:<br />
&bull;	Create an example dashboard (proof of concept) and prepare a step-by-step guideline for company employees who will be responsible for preparing these dashboards in the future.<br />
&bull;	Ensure the guideline is easy to follow for employees with begginers/intermediate knowledge of computers, Windows, and Microsoft applications.<br /><br />
Company Objective: <br />
We aim to prepare individual dashboards for each department using data from their daily reports. Each dashboard should:<br />
&bull;	Include data from all the daily reports for the department since the beginning of 2024.<br />
&bull;	Allow us to select and display reports from specific dates.<br />
&bull;	Enable easy switching between dates within the same dashboard.<br />
&bull;	Visually present the data in tables, charts, columns, and lines.<br /><br />
Company Future Automation Goal: <br />
In the future, we want the following to be possible:<br />
&bull;	Automatically save incoming daily reports from Outlook to SharePoint or OneDrive.<br />
&bull;	Automatically update the respective department&rsquo;s Power BI dashboard with new reports from SharePoint/OneDrive.<br />
&bull;	Ensure immediate access to today&#039;s current report (the latest report from SharePoint/OneDrive) upon opening the Power BI link for the department&#039;s dashboard.<br />
&bull;	Provide immediate access to view and select data from any date, past or present.<br /><br />
Next Steps: <br />
If you need more details about the structure of the daily reports and the specific data to be presented on the dashboards, please let me know. I can provide an example report and explain the necessary data. We can discuss these details further once you confirm your capability to handle this task.<br /><br />
Request for Confirmation: <br />
Please confirm if you are capable of completing this task and providing us with a tutorial for future reference. If you agree, I will send you an example table and images to help you prepare.<br />
If you are able to complete this task and provide a clear tutorial for future use, I will undoubtedly give you a 5-star rating. Payment will be smooth and prompt.<br /><br />
I look forward to your response and to working with you on this project.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: May 17, 2024 09:20 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Data Visualization<br /><b>Skills</b>:Microsoft Power BI,     Data Visualization,     Data Analysis,     Microsoft Excel,     Microsoft Power Automate

We are looking to establish some best practices and automation for data to automatically be pulled and refreshed within PowerBI for the last 4 week period, updating itself with each subsequent day. <br /><br />
There are two methods we would like to go about doing this. The first is, if it&#039;s possible within PowerBI, we can sort the total quantity of products and modifiers that are used on average within every 15 minute period, and then push that data to a Google Sheet to convert the products and modifiers to the KDS tags that we use within the kitchen. <br /><br />
The second way would be, if we cannot do it the first way, if we can just get the product data and modifier data to automatically pull and display within a Google Sheet, then we can do all the calculations there in order to get to the end we desire, of seeing all the KDS tags and the quantity of each we need (on average) every 15 minutes.<br /><br />
We would like to setup a discovery call so we can establish a proper scope and confirm this is even possible. <br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: May 20, 2024 13:02 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: General Virtual Assistance<br /><b>Skills</b>:Customer Service,     Clerical Skills,     Data Entry,     Administrative Support,     Spreadsheet Software,     Email Marketing,     Acuity Scheduling

Odoo Expert Required - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Odoo-Expert-Required_%7E0120a0b0fa638531d7?source=rss,New Zealand,Full Stack Development,['Odoo'],2024-05-21T18:52:00,True,15.0,35.0,,"Hi,<br /><br />
I am representing a not-for-profit organisation that is still in its inception phase and growing.<br /><br />
We have been using several different software to run our functions - Xero for accounting, Monday for workflow management, PowerBI to view our funding targets, Excel to manage funding allocation etc and various other software.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have reached a point where it has become extremely messy.<br /><br />
I need an Odoo expert to assist us urgently as we are approaching the end of our financial year and we would like to start afresh for the next financial year.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will be using some of Odoo&#039;s modules as it is (CRM, Knowledge, Project, Timesheets and most of the HR functions).&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue using Xero as our financial module.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the key things we need customised are the following:<br /><br />
Donor Management System<br />
We obtain funding from several large donors.&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to track funding from the application stage right up to the time we obtain the funds. This process needs to be managed in several stages and I do have a flow chart for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, this is managed in Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp;We also use PowerBI to see how we are tracking against our targets.<br /><br />
Grant Management System<br />
Following receiving the funding,&nbsp;&nbsp;we grant the funds to other smaller organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Organisations apply for funding.&nbsp;&nbsp;This process at the moment is being managed manually.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a large grant call in July 2024 and hence I need module to be created before 15 June so that we can test this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again this is a process of several test including a Due Diligence process.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a flow chart for this too.<br /><br />
In summary<br />
I would prefer to work with one developer to do both of these functions but I am running out of time as I need all of the above done by 15 June at the latest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence if I need to engage two different developers in this instance I will.<br /><br />
I also have a phobia with this platform as getting follow-up service is almost impossible.<br /><br />
I need someone reliable that I can count on as there will be ongoing work in the sense that there are other not-for-profits that I work with on a global scale; this organisation is in the Pacific region.<br /><br />
There will be a need to sign a Non-Disclosure Statement as part of this development.<br /><br />
If you are keen, please submit a proposal as all I need is a template created as I have an outline of how both the databases function.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be a need for an ongoing service contract as I am the Financial Controller of the organisation but look after HR and IT as well and don&#039;t have the time to do everything.<br /><br />
I look forward to your proposals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />
Please note: GENERIC proposals will not be entertained.<br /><br />
Thanks and regards<br />

Overview:<br />
We are looking to create a live production scheduling dashboard to be displayed on a 50&amp;quot; 4K TV in our workshop. The TV will be mounted in PORTRAIT orientation.<br /><br />
__________<br />
Requirements:<br /><br />
Data Source: All data is contained in a single Google Sheet, which updates nightly around midnight.<br /><br />
Display: The dashboard should display the data in an easily digestible manner and be available via a web link. It will run continuously on a Raspberry Pi and be visible 24/7 on the production floor.<br /><br />
User Interaction: The dashboard should be designed for passive viewing, requiring no interaction from the team.<br /><br />
Data Updates: The dashboard must always display the most recent data from the Google Sheet, which updates daily and sometimes more frequently.<br /><br />
Data Quantity: My sample data displays approximately 6 customer orders, with 21 products ordered. However, we will often have up to 15 customer orders, with 40 products ordered. The dashboard should scale to this content without spilling off the screen<br /><br />
Design: The display should be modern and visually appealing, with careful consideration given to font sizes and overall design for easy readability.<br /><br />
__________<br />
Data Details:<br /><br />
Content: The dashboard will display orders, each potentially associated with single or multiple products.<br /><br />
Key Fields:<br />
* Order Name<br />
* Storm Name (product code name)<br />
* Status<br />
* Scheduled Completion Week<br />
* Desired End/Completion Week<br /><br />
Highlighting: Orders with a scheduled completion date later than the desired end date should be highlighted.<br /><br />
Additional Information:<br />
* Item Number<br />
* Item Description<br /><br />
__________<br />
Design Priorities:<br /><br />
* High Priority: Order Name, Storm Name, Status<br /><br />
* Low Priority: Item Number, Item Description (smaller fonts)<br /><br />
* Optional: Integration of images if it enhances readability and comprehension.<br /><br />
Platforms:<br />
We are open to using various platforms for this dashboard, including but not limited to:<br /><br />
* Looker Studio<br />
* Power BI<br />
* DataBox<br />
* Excel<br />
* Any other suitable platform<br /><br />
Experience:<br />
We attempted a basic setup in Looker Studio but require a professional touch to achieve our vision.<br /><br />
Application:<br />
Please provide samples of similar work or a mockup using the attached sample CSV Google Sheet.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $20.00-$45.00

I have attempted to do this myself with the pre-built connectors but I do not think they work now, hence I need to develop a bespoke solution. <br />
I am thinking that this solution can be built using demo account data from Hubspot to begin with, and then you can show me how to replace the demo account credentials with my actual Hubspot credentials. <br />
My end goal for this is to have my Azure SQL database connected to Power BI (already achieved) to build custom visualisations. I just need the connection built. <br />
If you think there is a better way to do this, then I am open to other suggestions. <br />
Finally, there is plenty of scope with this piece should the job be completed in a satisfactory manner. My business has a requirement to build many connectors into our Azure environment in the near future. <br />

I am looking to seek services of an advanced level MS Excel, Power Query and Power BI expert. Basically I frequently trade in stock market and I have trade confirmations in the form of PDF files. I want to develop a Dashboard and automate my record of transactions related to stock market so that I don&rsquo;t need to manually maintain any record. Snapshots of my requirement is as below:<br />
1.	Develop an automated and fully dynamic dashboard (either in excel of using BI, I don&rsquo;t mind that). The dashboard must show all the time:<br />
a.	Cumulative realized gain/losses of my transaction (month wise and year wise)<br />
b.	Cumulative unrealized gain/losses at any point in time<br />
c.	Quantities and cost of unsold shares at any point in time<br />
d.	Automation of above record through Power Query or Power BI so that I simply place new transaction files in the folder and my whole record get update through one link. <br />
Notes: <br />
I need to implement a to c through First-in-First-out method. I can explain this at a later stage once anybody shows willingness to do this work.<br />
I am open to mutually agree a fair reimbursement of the efforts anybody would be required to deploy. However, the amount would only be payable upon development of a successful model. The bidder can show me the model online on his/her screen and once I am satisfied, we can move for delivery and payment. <br />
I can share the record of transactions once anybody shows willingness to take this project. <br />
Thanks<br />

I currently go on to my competitor recruitment company websites and copy and paste their job descriptions in to google, which then usually leads me to the original posting and the company that originally posted the job. This means I know what companies are spending money with my competition so I can direct marketing campaigns to them to take their business.<br />
I then input this data (job title, company, competitor, job description, date posted etc.) into google sheets so I can track the data. <br /><br />
I asked chatGPT to create a plan for how I can use AI tools to implement a way to automate this if I provide the websites of my direct competing recruitment agencies.<br /><br />
It is too complicated and technical for me to execute. Please provide me with :<br />
1. Do you understand the brief<br />
2. Have you done anything like this before<br />
3. Will you guarantee you can execute<br />
4. How much will you charge<br />
5. How many hours will it take you to execute<br />
6. My preference is to have this automation live in Make/Integromat. Please let me know if it is possible. <br /><br />
Here is the plan ChatGPT gave me as an example:<br />
Automating the process of tracking job postings from competitor recruitment websites involves several steps, each of which can be streamlined using AI and automation tools. Below is a comprehensive plan to automate this workflow:<br /><br />
### Step 1: Web Scraping<br />
#### Tools: <br />
- **Python with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy**<br />
- **Automation platforms like UiPath or Selenium**<br /><br />
**Action:**<br />
1. **Web Scraping Setup:** Create a web scraper to automatically extract job descriptions from your competitor&#039;s websites.<br />
2. **Frequency:** Schedule the scraper to run daily or weekly, depending on the frequency of job posting updates.<br /><br />
### Step 2: Text Extraction and Processing<br />
#### Tools:<br />
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries like NLTK or spaCy**<br />
- **Google Cloud Natural Language API**<br /><br />
**Action:**<br />
1. **Extract Job Descriptions:** Parse the scraped web data to extract relevant job descriptions.<br />
2. **NLP Processing:** Use NLP techniques to clean and structure the job descriptions.<br /><br />
### Step 3: Search for Original Postings<br />
#### Tools:<br />
- **Google Search API**<br />
- **Custom Search JSON API**<br /><br />
**Action:**<br />
1. **Automated Search Queries:** Use the extracted job descriptions to automate Google search queries.<br />
2. **Result Analysis:** Extract and analyze the top search results to identify the original job postings.<br /><br />
### Step 4: Data Extraction from Original Postings<br />
#### Tools:<br />
- **BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for Web Scraping**<br />
- **NLP Tools for Data Extraction**<br /><br />
**Action:**<br />
1. **Identify Client Names:** Scrape and extract client names and other relevant details from the original job postings.<br /><br />
### Step 5: Data Storage and Management<br />
#### Tools:<br />
- **Google Sheets API**<br />
- **Database Systems (MySQL, PostgreSQL)**<br /><br />
**Action:**<br />
1. **Automate Data Entry:** Use the Google Sheets API to automatically input the extracted data into your tracking spreadsheet.<br />
2. **Database Option:** Alternatively, store the data in a structured database for better management and querying.<br /><br />
### Step 6: Monitoring and Reporting<br />
#### Tools:<br />
- **Google Sheets/Excel for Reporting**<br />
- **BI Tools like Tableau or Power BI**<br /><br />
**Action:**<br />
1. **Automate Reports:** Create automated reports and dashboards to visualize and track the extracted client information and analyze trends over time.<br />
2. **Alerts and Notifications:** Set up automated alerts for new client data entries or significant changes.<br /><br />
### Detailed Implementation Steps:<br /><br />
1. **Web Scraping Implementation:**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```python<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import requests<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from bs4 import BeautifulSoup<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def scrape_jobs(competitor_url):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;response = requests.get(competitor_url)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, &#039;html.parser&#039;)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;jobs = soup.find_all(&#039;div&#039;, class_=&#039;job-description&#039;)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job_descriptions = [job.get_text() for job in jobs]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return job_descriptions<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br /><br />
2. **Automated Google Search:**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```python<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from googleapiclient.discovery import build<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def google_search(query, api_key, cse_id):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service = build(&amp;quot;customsearch&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;v1&amp;quot;, developerKey=api_key)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;res = service.cse().list(q=query, cx=cse_id).execute()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return res[&#039;items&#039;]<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;job_desc = &amp;quot;Sample job description&amp;quot;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;search_results = google_search(job_desc, &#039;your_api_key&#039;, &#039;your_cse_id&#039;)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br /><br />
3. **Data Entry to Google Sheets:**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```python<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;import gspread<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;def update_google_sheet(data):<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scope = [&amp;quot;https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds&amp;quot;, &#039;https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive&#039;]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creds = ServiceAccountCredentials.from_json_keyfile_name(&#039;path_to_creds.json&#039;, scope)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;client = gspread.authorize(creds)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheet = client.open(&amp;quot;Client Tracker&amp;quot;).sheet1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheet.append_row(data)<br /><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;update_google_sheet([&amp;quot;Client Name&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Job Description&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Date&amp;quot;])<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;```<br /><br />
4. **Scheduling and Automation:**<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scheduling:** Use cron jobs or Windows Task Scheduler to run your scripts at regular intervals.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **Automation Tools:** Consider using tools like UiPath or Zapier to handle parts of the automation that require interaction with web interfaces.<br /><br />
### Final Thoughts<br />
Automating this process will save significant time and effort, allowing you to focus on more strategic tasks. Ensure to comply with legal and ethical standards when scraping data and using competitor information.<br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: June 05, 2024 02:03 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Scripting &amp; Automation<br /><b>Skills</b>:UiPath,     Beautiful Soup,     Python,     JSON,     NLTK,     spaCy,     Google Search API

We will be handling the data side of this site, while you will be working as a full-stack web developer in finishing out our work in progress site that we mocked up to be robust and have all the functionality that we need.<br /><br />
Future Opportunities: This project could become a valuable product for our business, with the potential to become a full-time part of the team and even work visa sponsorship to the United States in the future.<br /><br />
Project Overview<br />
You are developing a Django-based web application that includes user authentication, Stripe integration for subscription management, and Gmail for sending emails. The project is partially completed with a GitHub repository that already includes basic implementations of Stripe payment, user authentication, email verification, and some HTML/CSS styling. You need a skilled developer to finalize and enhance the existing features. The web application will offer a 3-tier subscription system for accessing proprietary data collected through your data pipeline.<br /><br />
Subscription Tiers<br />
The subscription system will have three tiers: Individual, Business, and Enterprise, each with distinct features and access levels.<br /><br />
Individual Plan<br /><br />
Type: Service<br />
User: 1<br />
Business Plan<br /><br />
Type: Service<br />
Admins: 2 (can add and remove accounts for the subscription)<br />
Users: 8<br />
Enterprise Plan<br /><br />
Type: Service<br />
Admins: 5 (can add and remove accounts for the subscription)<br />
Users: 100<br /><br />
Developer Responsibilities<br />
- Finalize User Authentication: Ensure robust and secure user authentication using Django Allauth or a similar solution along with admin accounts for subscriptions.<br />
- Complete Stripe Integration: Implement and test the three-tier subscription system with Stripe, ensuring seamless payment processing and subscription management.<br />
- Enhance Email Functionality: Ensure reliable email notifications using Gmail SMTP or another service.<br />
- Provide Integration Path for Big Data: Offer a clear approach for my CTO and I to begin integrating and visualizing many different views of a very large financial dataset (~500 GB) using high-end visualization tools, with a preference for plotly express, grafana, or power bi.<br />
- Deployment and Scalability: Develop functionality for both local development and deployment to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS or Azure). Provide a clear path for scaling and managing large datasets.<br />
- Code Cleanup and Documentation: Refactor the existing codebase to ensure readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Document the code and setup process clearly.<br /><br />
Deliverables<br />
- Functional Subscription System: A working subscription system with Stripe integration for Individual, Business, and Enterprise plans.<br />
- Secure User Authentication: Robust user authentication and authorization system.<br />
- Email Notifications: Reliable email sending for account and subscription-related notifications.<br />
- Integration Path for Big Data: Recommendations and guidelines for me and my team to begin integrating and visualizing the large financial dataset into the framework.<br />
- Deployment Scripts: Scripts and documentation for deploying the application to local and cloud environments.<br />
- Code Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of the codebase and setup instructions.<br /><br />
Current Project State<br />
- GitHub Repository: Existing repository with basic implementations of Stripe payment, user authentication, email verification, and some HTML/CSS styling.<br />
- Basic Functionalities: User authentication and Stripe payment system are partially built out.<br /><br />
Additional Information<br />
- Data Handling: My CTO and I, both data scientists, will handle the migration of our data into your suggested data storage and visualization setup and deal with that integration. But we are not web developers and will need a clear path for integrating this data into the web application.<br />
- Quality Assurance: Seeking an expert developer to ensure high-quality work that aligns with industry standards, completing the user subscription system, Stripe integration, SMTP setup, and ensuring functionality in both development and production environments.<br /><br />

Notes<br />
Prior experience with Django, Stripe integration, and handling large datasets is essential.<br />
Familiarity with cloud deployment (AWS or Azure) is highly desirable.<br />
Strong emphasis on clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.<br />
Preference for django sites with big data using data viz plugin like plotly express, grafana, or power bi for high-end big data financial data visualizations.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $1,000

I own a small business and would love to see if Microstrategy will be helpful in data analysis. <br /><br />
After playing around with the demo I can clearly see that my time will be much better spent working with someone who is familiar with Microstrategy. <br /><br />
Our data analysis needs are not complex, but as the business owner I know I don&#039;t have time to learn the ins and outs of how to import my data (it is all just in a spreadsheet currently). <br /><br />

We are a small construction company and currently use Tally Prime as our primary accounting software. However, our senior management team is not very proficient in operating Tally. Therefore, we need a system that integrates Tally Prime with MS Excel in predefined formats.<br /><br />
The management needs to view real-time data, such as bank balances, receivables, payables, inventory, and more, directly in Excel. We do not want the accounts team to manually upload data frequently; instead, we aim for a one-time connection that provides live, up-to-date reports whenever needed.<br /><br />
Given your expertise, I believe you can handle this task with ease. Could you please let me know how long this would take and if you need any further information?<br /><br />

1. Assessment of my needs to find solutions<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Set up of Teams given my specific needs<br />
3. Integration of MS 365 apps with Teams (duh)<br />
4. Ability to grow as company grows<br />
5. Training on Teams and ongoing support.<br /><br />
I have experience with Teams but need help with the above.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hoping to get this started in the next week with a finish time of say a month?&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks!<br />

For a powerBI dashboard we are currently trying to come up with a new data model design. In the starting point, the data had the wrong hierarchy and also did not aggregate the data correctly with time trackings. <br /><br />
We have the following tables:<br />
- PP-Issue (JIRA): hierarchy level 1<br />
- Epic (JIRA): hierarchy level&nbsp;&nbsp;2<br />
- Issue (JIRA): hierarchy level&nbsp;&nbsp;3<br />
- Subissue (JIRA): hierarchy level&nbsp;&nbsp;4<br />
- TimeTracking Table. should be joined<br /><br />
Currently, the correct Hierarchy from PP-Issue to Epic to Issue to subissue is established, but the time trackings are not assigned correctly.<br /><br />
I would need a direct consultation session (1-3 hours) to solve this problem. Therefore an advanced data modelling expert is needed to quickly grasp the problem and find a solution together.&nbsp;&nbsp;The consultation should take place in the next 3 days. <br /><br />
Issues to Address:<br />
The initial data hierarchy was incorrect.<br />
Data aggregation, especially with time tracking, was flawed.<br />
Although we have established the correct hierarchy from PP-Issue to Epic to Issue to Subissue, the time tracking data is still not assigned correctly.<br /><br />
Requirements:<br />
Advanced expertise in data modeling, particularly with Power BI.<br />
Experience with JIRA data structures is a plus.<br />
Availability for a consultation session within the next 3 days.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $25.00-$35.00

Power BI PoC in Azure / Pull Data from JSON API and Stage in Database  - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Power-PoC-Azure-Pull-Data-from-JSON-API-and-Stage-Database_%7E0106b3509e2128f3e7?source=rss,United Kingdom,Data Engineering,"['Microsoft Power BI', 'SQL', 'JSON', 'Python', 'Microsoft Azure', 'Microsoft Azure SQL Database', 'ETL Pipeline', 'API']",2024-06-22T10:33:00,False,,,200.0,"This project is to develop a PoC in Power BI to pull data from an IT Asset Management system (API) into a database, and then create some charts and reports in Power BI.<br /><br />
We have data in an IT Asset Management platform with a very well documented API. Data can be pulled via a Rest API or GraphQL.<br /><br />
We can provide the required API queries to extract the data.<br /><br />
There are multiple relational tables that will need to be synced, for example, Devices, Device Types, Manufactures, Costs, Cost Classifications, Forecasts, etc. Some of the tables are big, i.e. hundreds of thousands of rows, so performance is an important consideration.<br /><br /><br />
-- Milestone #1 - Solution Design $50<br /><br />
The first task is to come up with a design.<br /><br />
&bull;&nbsp;What is the best way to store data for Power BI? E.g. SQL, OneLake, etc. What is the optimal Azure setup?<br /><br />
&bull;&nbsp;The solution should support &ldquo;daily data syncs&rdquo;, e.g. we&rsquo;ll sync all the data from the ITAM API into the database each day so the Power BI reports are fresh. In the future we could use this to automate reports with Power Automate (not part of this project).<br /><br />
&bull;&nbsp;We need to be able to copy the solution to different clients, so it needs to be simple / possible to replicate. We need to have a very simple process for creating a new environment. For example: create a new DB, copy the master Power BI templates, connect the API, etc.<br /><br /><br />
-- Milestone #2 - Sync the Data $50<br /><br />
&bull;&nbsp;Write a script (ideally in Python) that takes the data from our API and pushes it to the &ldquo;chosen data storage platform&rdquo;, e.g. SQL.<br /><br />
&bull;&nbsp;Create relations between tables, e.g. a &ldquo;Device&rdquo; may have a &ldquo;Manufacturer&rdquo; field that links to the &ldquo;Manufacturer&rdquo; table, so the reports in Power BI are enriched and interactive/relational.<br /><br /><br />
-- Milestone #3 - Power BI Report Template for ITAM $50<br /><br />
With the data in the database, this task is to create a Power BI report / template that models the infrastructure data from the data in the database.<br /><br />
The main goal here is to provide different visualisations of the inventory data across multiple pages. For example; count of devices by role, devices by region/site, etc.<br /><br />
Once we have the data schema in place and some example charts, it should be easy for us to add more charts.<br /><br /><br />
-- Milestone #4 - Power BI Report Template for Financial Reports $50<br /><br />
Our platform generates financial reports. Similar to Milestone #3, this task is to create some sample reports that model the data. For example, a 10 year financial forecast by supplier.<br /><br />
These reports should have options to change the data in the charts / table. E.g. switch supplier, or filter by region/site.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $200

It&rsquo;s a user task summary report. <br /><br />
The way it works is it time stamps how users drag patients through a workflow. I have a floor plan of our patient working area. <br /><br />
The data correlates to the floor plan. Users take patients into the room and work them up, take them to other rooms and test them, and then take them to rooms to see the doctor. <br /><br />
I want to run a simulation of the work done in a day and visualize how patients are being moved around the office and which technicians are working them up and how long they are taking. <br /><br />
I could envision a cool 3D video rendition of the office layout too like an auto cad drawing with patients and techs moving around. This or an over view look like an Ariel view of the floor plan with colored dots moving from room to room and understanding where the bottle necks are and making a heat map of movement.<br /><br />
This will be good to recap our session. The program should be able to interpret new data. So I can run the report again, export it, and import it into the simulator and it will read the users data and make a simulation of the session. <br /><br />
I want to send these out as recap videos for the staff on a daily bases. <br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $32.00-$60.00

Finish Building A Contract Management Dashboard via React - Upwork,https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Finish-Building-Contract-Management-Dashboard-via-React_%7E015fcdaa966e70db8f?source=rss,Canada,Full Stack Development,"['React', 'API']",2024-06-28T01:00:00,True,7.0,11.0,,"I am looking for someone to take over this project - it is 85% done but the developer has gone missing and we are looking to get this wrapped up. Need someone that can easily take over this project and has experience with API&#039;s and can easily finish this up.<br /><br />
Here was the original post, but please remember most of it is done. We just need the Microsoft or Pax8 API connected, some history work done and an admin page really.<br /><br />
** ORIGINAL POST BELOW***<br /><br />
Scenario for an admin named Mitch<br /><br />
Mitch Logs in to App (either created on PowerBI or React, whichever makes more sense) (SSO w/ Microsoft a huge bonus but not at all required)<br />
Mitch sees a dashboard of Client contracts expiring in 120 days or less. This would include Company Name, Date of Expiry, and Contract Value/MRR (monthly recurring revenue) expiring.<br />
Mitch clicks on &ldquo;Contracts&rdquo; then&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;quot;+ New Contract&amp;quot;<br />
Mitch fills in:<br /><br />
Company (If can be synced from SyncroMSP (our Professional Services Automation tool that has a public API), even better, if not then this is manual)<br />
Company Name: Random AG Company<br />
Contract Start Date: April 1st, 2023<br />
Contract Term: 24, 36, 48, 60-month selections (chose 60 months)<br />
Contract End Date: Auto-Generated by Term selection<br />
Monthly Recurring Revenue: $2200.00<br />
Contract Value: $2200.00 x 60 months = Value<br />
Contract Computer Users: 10<br />
Contract Email Only Users: 5<br />
Contract Computers: 15<br />
Contract Servers: 2<br />
Contract Locations: 1<br /><br />
^^This could change too if we start adding our VoIP offering instead. Ability to create fields as I wish.<br /><br />
Save<br /><br />
Somewhere we would need to bind this company with Pax8 (our license reseller) so that it knows which subscriptions belong to which company. This could also be done with direct integration to Microsoft with the clients we are Partners for.<br /><br />
Back on the dashboard, maybe there is another main alert of +- Contract Computer Users and Contract Email Only Users<br /><br />
In Pax8 the licenses linked to the values above are as such:<br /><br />
Contract Computer Users =&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;M365 Business Premium&rdquo;<br />
Contract Email Only Users = &ldquo;Exchange Online Plan 1&rdquo;<br /><br />
So if the scenario below happens:<br /><br />
10 - Contract Computer Users =&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;M365 Business Premium&rdquo; - 13<br />
5 - Contract Email Only Users = &ldquo;Exchange Online Plan 1&rdquo; &ndash; 5<br /><br />
We would want an email to be sent stating that they are above their 2-person &ldquo;grace&rdquo; for Contracted Computer Users. (I guess we should add a field in the contract about what the &ldquo;grace&rdquo; number is)<br /><br />
This should also just be clearly shown on the dashboard (not emailed out), if it is even 1 above on either of those lines so we can be aware of it.<br /><br />
This was my idea when it was Pax8, the same idea exists if we can talk straight to Microsoft and forget about Pax8. Would also like to be able to include costs for these services and have an updated total of what the profit margin is on each one.<br /><br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $7.00-$11.00

We need an expert who can advise us on the best practices for establishing Power BI dashboards.<br /><br />
Project Overview:<br /><br />
The dashboard should consist of one or two pages and must be exportable to PDF for inclusion in larger monthly reports. It will draw data from two sources:<br /><br />
Syncro RMM - https://community.syncromsp.com/t/power-bi/12173 &amp;amp; https://community.syncromsp.com/t/database-exports/12175<br />
HaloPSA - https://halopsa.com/integrations/power-bi-psa-integration/<br /><br />
Ideally the data displayed is no more than 24 hrs old, even better if it&#039;s live data.<br /><br />
The dashboard should include the following metrics, displayed as gauges or tiles that can be moved around to suit different layouts:<br /><br />
Asset &amp;amp; Device Metrics:<br />
Total device counts of PCs, servers, and other network devices.<br />
Breakdown of workstations by their age.<br />
Percentage of workstations covered by warranty and not.<br />
Percentage of devices with antivirus installed.<br />
Percentage of devices that are fully patched.<br />
A list of firewalls with model numbers and operating system versions.<br />
Total number of alerts detected and total number resolved in the last 12 months.<br />
Total number of alerts detected and total number resolved in the last 30 days months.<br /><br />
Support and Ticket Metrics:<br />
Total number of new tickets lodged and total number tickets resolved in last 12 months.<br />
Total number of new tickets lodged and total number tickets resolved in last 30 days.<br />
Average customer satisfaction last 12 months.<br />
A pie chart of ticket categories logged in the last 30 days and 12 months.<br /><br />
Other Requirements:<br /><br />
- The connection of data must be secure. <br />
- The dashboard must be easily filterable by client name.<br />
- Ideally, we can drill down into data formatted as a list when clicking on one of the above &amp;quot;tiles&amp;quot;.<br />
- We need the ability to change date ranges for the above metrics on the fly as required.<br />
- The dashboard should be designed so that it can be built upon and improved in future iterations and the data queries should be readable by other people.<br />
- Use our company colour scheme and logo where it makes sense.<br />
- We rely on your expertise to tell us what is required to make this work, but we are more than capable of procuring the required licenses, setting up the API access, etc. to ensure you have everything you need to create the data source connections and build the dashboard.<br /><br />
If this project is successful, we will have additional work and more dashboards for you to develop.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $22.00-$54.00

I have two tables: one table contains the names of asset groups (such as buildings, cars, furniture, etc.), and the other table is for asset transactions (assettrans). The asset transactions table has two columns: &amp;quot;transdate&amp;quot; for the transaction date and &amp;quot;transtype&amp;quot; for the type of transaction. The transaction types I have are 1, 2, 3, and 4, each representing a specific type of transaction linked to the table of transaction types&#039; names. I want to calculate the opening balance for assets and depreciation, as shown in the image. I need to calculate the opening balance for assets and depreciation. The opening balance for assets should meet the condition that the transaction type is 1 or 2, and the opening balance for depreciation should have a transaction type of 3 or 4. How can I calculate the opening balances for each of them using DAX? I don&#039;t want to use the ready-made functions like OPENINGBALANCEYEAR or OPENINGBALANCEMONTH because the client wants to select a specific period, for example, from March 2022 to March 2023. Also, I don&#039;t think these built-in functions can handle this requirement. I appreciate your assistance. Thank you.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $17.00-$50.00

The Dream:<br /><br />
I want to build a reporting tool - that makes people excited to use it. Where charts and graphs have a layer of animation and gamification so that each experience has a real &#039;wow&#039; factor. <br /><br />
For example imagine a bar chart, but instead of just a standard chart - imagine a wizard runs on and casts a spell, the latest month&#039;s bar erupts from the shaking ground. It&#039;s this level of animation and immersive that I want to build. Not a standard flat bar chart but something 3d and highly themed.<br /><br />
The next complex element would be automation - I envisage a scenario in which you can segment your customer base, and then press a button to &amp;quot;find more like this&amp;quot; and either RPA or some other form of automation would go and make you a list of prospective customers in that field.<br /><br />
As examples of current tools this would be a mix between a visualisation tools such as Metabase, Power BI, Tableau and automation tools such as Linked Helper.<br /><br />
I&#039;m looking for a development team - perhaps with a background in games development might be best to build a MVP- maybe just showing a few charts to begin with and then get funding from there.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $10

The dashboard should consist of one or two pages and must be exportable to PDF for inclusion in larger monthly reports. It will draw data from two sources:<br /><br />
Syncro RMM - https://community.syncromsp.com/t/power-bi/12173 &amp;amp; https://community.syncromsp.com/t/database-exports/12175<br />
HaloPSA - https://halopsa.com/integrations/power-bi-psa-integration/<br /><br />
Ideally the data displayed is no more than 24 hrs old, even better if it&#039;s live data.<br /><br />
The dashboard should include the following metrics, displayed as gauges or tiles that can be moved around to suit different layouts:<br /><br />
Asset &amp;amp; Device Metrics:<br />
Total device counts of PCs, servers, and other network devices.<br />
Breakdown of workstations by their age.<br />
Percentage of workstations covered by warranty and not.<br />
Percentage of devices with antivirus installed.<br />
Percentage of devices that are fully patched.<br />
A list of firewalls with model numbers and operating system versions.<br />
Total number of alerts detected and total number resolved in the last 12 months.<br />
Total number of alerts detected and total number resolved in the last 30 days months.<br /><br />
Support and Ticket Metrics:<br />
Total number of new tickets lodged and total number tickets resolved in last 12 months.<br />
Total number of new tickets lodged and total number tickets resolved in last 30 days.<br />
Average customer satisfaction last 12 months.<br />
A pie chart of ticket categories logged in the last 30 days and 12 months.<br /><br />
Other Requirements:<br /><br />
- The connection of data must be secure. <br />
- The dashboard must be easily filterable by client name.<br />
- Ideally, we can drill down into data formatted as a list when clicking on one of the above &amp;quot;tiles&amp;quot;.<br />
- We need the ability to change date ranges for the above metrics on the fly as required.<br />
- The dashboard should be designed so that it can be built upon and improved in future iterations and the data queries should be readable by other people.<br />
- Use our company colour scheme and logo where it makes sense.<br />
- We rely on your expertise to tell us what is required to make this work, but we are more than capable of procuring the required licenses, setting up the API access, etc. to ensure you have everything you need to create the data source connections and build the dashboard.<br /><br />
If this project is successful, we will have additional work and more dashboards for you to develop.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $22.00-$54.00

I can provide the excel to you. I need an chart which can be rendered in a browser once I finish running the script. <br />
I need the chart to be exactly looking like this one<br />
https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/seattle_weather_interactive.html<br />
and the language should be python and if we use altair charting library, it would be great but up to you. <br /><br />
The moment I feed an csv file, it should give me an chart<br /><br />
The X - Axis should be the time and the Y-Axis should be the LTP<br /><br />
In the url, https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/seattle_weather_interactive.html , there are range calculations. I need a range calculation automatically calculated from the LTP column . <br /><br />
I can discuss more but I need all of the below to be captured in both the top chart and the bottom chart<br /><br />
LTP<br />
BuyPrice<br />
BuyQty<br />
SellPrice<br />
SellQty <br />
LTQ<br />

I am relatively new to PowerBI. I am helping my hospital make an interface to interact with patient data for medical studies. I want the end user to be able to use Boolean logic to generate a table that they can export. The user should use a slicer/filter to create a selection of studies that is shown on a Table/Matrix Table. It should allow user to do something like: show studies that had [(Parameter1 = Blue or Red, but not yellow) AND (Parameter2 = Medium or Large) ] OR [(Parameter1 = Green) AND (Parameter3 contains &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot; OR &amp;quot;kidney&amp;quot;)]. Then the user can select which columns are shown in the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note, there are currently 2200 parameters (I am happy to do the manual work of making individual slicers if needed.).&nbsp;&nbsp;The approach should be very visually simple such that someone who doesn&#039;t know anything about PowerBI can find the right buttons easily to accomplish this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am hoping to pay an expert by the hour to show me how to accomplish this, using off the shelf or add in options in PowerBI.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $36.00-$72.00

Overview: Edifice is a hospitality technology company that is optimizing design prototypes in hotels. We combine our unique dataset of how people use the space with hotel datasets (sales, guests, etc) to create insights to drive revenue and savings opportunities. <br /><br />
Previous Dashboards: We created previous dashboards using Microsoft Power BI that are a good reference to understand what we want to do in Bubble. Bubble.io was chosen for the next version of the dashboard. <br /><br />
Design: Client will give you design direction from designs in Figma and sketches that are similar to dashboards done in Power BI previously. <br /><br />
Database: We have imported initial datasets into Bubble from AWS. There will be additional datasets from the hotel that we will import later and add to the dashboard.<br /><br />
Tasks:<br /><br />
Responsible for reviewing past and current dashboard designs and discussing with client for clarifications. <br /><br />
Create dashboard layout and functionality shown in previous and current designs. <br /><br />
Use database in Bubble to create charts and the ability to filter charts based on time/date range, hotel property location, hotel property comparison, revenue, etc. <br /><br />
Use chart plugins for charting needs. Ability to create custom chart may be required.<br /><br />
Back and forth with the client to test designs, function, buttons, charts, etc.<br /><br />
Ability to easily create, add or remove chats with the same design style.<br /><br />
Initial dashboard to be set up in 3 days to show to clients customers. <br /><br />
Dashboard Buildout Priorities<br /><br />
Overall dashboard layout and pages<br />
Add charts<br />
Login landing page with the credentials<br />
Admin dashboard for other users to sign and track usage.<br />
Add hotel properties and compare property metrics<br /><br />
Deliverables<br /><br />
Fully functioning dashboard for 1 hotel property that can be replicated for additional new properties<br /><br />
Dashboard functionality and design meets requirements shared from discussions with client and from past and current dashboard designs<br /><br />
Teach client to edit, change and update the dashboard themselves to reduce back and forth. <br /><br />
Information and knowledge of Bubble is missing above. You are the domain expert and look to you for suggestions and better ways of creating the dashboard. Please take ownership of the project and guide the client based on goals. Thank you!<br /><br />
I will share designs with you when we schedule a call. I am looking to move quickly and get this up and running in 3 days. Looking forward to speaking and working with you!<br /><br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $500

Description:<br />
We are seeking a skilled partner to assist our marketing agency in migrating our marketing KPI dashboards from Grow to Looker. This role involves working closely with our Director of Digital, who is based in the Eastern US (UTC -5) and will serve as your primary point of contact for project access and inquiries. The Director has significant experience collaborating with offshore resources and will provide clear user acceptance criteria for each graph, ensuring a smooth workflow by addressing any potential blockers promptly.<br /><br />
Project Overview:<br />
Grow is an all-in-one data warehousing and visualization platform that we have decided to move away from. As we determine our long-term solution, we need an interim migration to Looker due to its seamless integration with Big Query, where our data is currently stored, and its cost-effectiveness.<br /><br />
Scope of Work:<br />
Migrate a Single Dashboard: The initial task involves migrating one Grow dashboard containing approximately 16 graphs to Looker.<br />
Graph Recreation: Each graph in Grow will be recreated in Looker, with the expectation that many static snapshots will be transformed into dynamic, time-series graphs. This means each original Grow graph will be represented by 1-2 Looker graphs.<br />
KPI Cards: Along with the graphs, you will create a series of KPI cards for each graph (1-5 KPI cards per graph) in Looker.<br />
Data Sources: Pre-built data sources in Looker, sourced from Big Query, including Active Campaign, GA4, Adwords, and SQL tables from customer CRMs integrated via Improvado.<br />
Unstyled State Delivery: The dashboard should be delivered in an unstyled state within the first 7 days for evaluation.<br /><br />
Key Requirements:<br />
Proficiency in Looker: Extensive experience with Looker and its integration with Big Query.<br />
Data Visualization Expertise: Ability to recreate complex graphs and KPI cards accurately.<br />
Attention to Detail: Ensuring data accuracy and consistency during the migration process.<br />
Time Management: Capability to deliver the unstyled dashboard within the stipulated 7-day timeframe.<br />
Opportunity for Additional Work:<br /><br />
Upon satisfactory completion of the initial dashboard, there is potential for 5+ additional dashboard migration projects, with a deadline of August 20th.<br /><br />
How to Apply:<br />
Please submit your proposal detailing your experience with Looker and similar migration projects. Include examples of past work, particularly those involving Grow or similar platforms, and a brief plan on how you intend to approach this migration.<br /><br />
We look forward to collaborating with a dedicated professional who can ensure a seamless transition and maintain the integrity of our data visualizations.<br /><br /><b>Hourly Range</b>: $10.00-$20.00

We&#039;re TestGorilla, a fast-growing HR tech startup that helps hiring teams make better hiring decisions faster and bias-free.<br /><br />
Over the past year, we&rsquo;ve experienced tremendous growth. More than 10,000 companies have replaced CVs with our assessments to screen candidates in an unbiased and data-driven way.<br /><br />
As we scale our efforts in 2024 and beyond, we&rsquo;re looking for an expert in Power BI&nbsp;&nbsp;to collaborate with us in creating a test to evaluate candidates who apply to positions that need good knowledge of Power BI skills.<br /><br />
**What&#039;s in for you?**<br />
- Build your reputation: We share information about you with thousands of our customers, which is a good opportunity to showcase your skills and expertise in your field. (If you prefer not to have your name shown, we can do that, too).<br /><br />
- Receive expert coaching: This will be a rewarding and collaborative process. We&#039;ll be providing guidance and feedback throughout the project at predetermined intervals. In the end, we will also conduct a technical review with a third-party expert.<br /><br />

You will:<br />
- Create 26 new questions to add to the existing test.<br />
- Review and edit 27 existing questions that need to be improved.<br /><br />

All questions submitted must be your own, original work. All material is checked for originality and copyright issues.<br /><br />
The project usually takes around 3-5 weeks (though it&#039;s not a full-time project), and weekly deliverables are expected. The project can move faster than proposed if you have the time availability.<br /><br />
**Who are we looking for?**<br />
You should:<br />
- Be a deep subject-matter expert in Power BI with extensive experience in the field and a proven track record of creating appropriate material.<br />

This API has been challenging to navigate around and I could use help and teaching through the whole ETL process around this API. I have attached a file to show what the raw data looks like when pulling a list out of Clickup. In this file you will see how the information coming through it is not usable. Depending on the field being a text, formula, dropdown, or custom column, the formatting is different.
